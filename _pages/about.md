- I'm a systems theorist who builds mathematical models of complex biological and social systems. My goal is to understand how information is encoded into such systems, which is the first step in the neural processing pipeline and a guidepost for emerging models of artificial computation.
- In September 2024 I started as a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Francesco Bullo](https://fbullo.github.io/). In May 2024 I obtained a B.S in Mathematics from Rice University.
- In my free time, I sing acappella and bike around Southern California.
