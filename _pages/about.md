- I'm a systems theorist who builds and analyzes mathematical models of complex biological and social systems. My goal is to understand how information is encoded into such systems and leverage this understanding towards the creation of novel modes of artificial computation.
- I am a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at UC Santa Barbara where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Francesco Bullo](https://fbullo.github.io/). Previously, I obtained a B.S in Mathematics from Rice University.
- In my free time, I sing acappella and bike around Southern California.
